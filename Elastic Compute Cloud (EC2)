it is IaaS
it is a private service, means runs in the private AWS zone
it is AZ resilient
on demand billing
use storage local on-host or elastick block store (EBS)
when you terminated a instance you can not go bck to running or stopped state. Those instances matters because of the costs. When is running consume netwok,cpu,
memory and storage, when stopped only storage is running. When terminated anything is using.

AMI - amazon machine image - can be used to create an EC2 instance or can be create from an EC2
AMI contains attached permissions, can be set public (everyne can launch images from ami), owner implicit allow (private), explicit specific aws acc allowed
AMI contains the boot volume (c:/ and /)
AMI contains block device mapping - determines which volume is the boot volume and hich is data volume
The OS expect to receive volumes presented to it as well as an ID and the block device mapping links the volume to the device ID


================ EC2 on the console ======================
first thing is to create key pairs, then create the instance. After creation wait for status check and instance state be completed. Aws does a chekc in those instances

To connect to instance (tere are many ways), right click on instance > connect > ssh client
