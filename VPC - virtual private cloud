it is a servive to connect your on premises network to aws private network when creating a hybrid environment.
service which allows to connect to other cloud platforms when creating multi cloud deployment
 
vpc is a virtual network inside aws. 
You are doing within an aws acc and region. Operates from multiple availability zones
by defaulkt is private and isolated even from other vpcs unless you allow

there are 2 types default and custom
one default vpc per region, but can have many customs vpcs in a region
custom need configura 100% and they are private by default
the defaul can removed and recreated
default can already configure, the structure are the same, pretty limiting for production deployments, it is not flexible as custom



They always have the same IP range and same '1 subnet per AZ' architecture. Which is 172.31.0.0/16
The resiliency comes with the divide subnet, every division are located in a differnet AZ.
Those subnets are divided /20 subnet

vpc default comes IGW (internet gateway), SG (security group) and NACL

by default, anythiong places in the default vpcs subnet is assigned a public IPv4

best poractice to no use the default vpc


================== how to create in aws acc================
serach for vpc > your vpcs > you see it is already created a default vpc
              > subnets > you see the subnets already create over the AZ
