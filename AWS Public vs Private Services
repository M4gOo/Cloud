aws service can be categorized two main types. They are referring to networking perspective only
  private - runs within a VPC, so only within that VPC (virtual private cloud) or connect that VPC can access the service
  public - accessed using public endpoints, like S3 (S3 can be accessed from anywhere)
  
  For public and private are permissions as well as networking, meaning to access a service you need consider networkin and permissions
  
  
  Inside the AWS we have aws private zone where you can create many VPCs
VPC cant communicate with each other unless you allow it, anything from internet can reach tehse private networks unless you configure it
Services can be placed, like EC2, this can access the internet and the internet can only access the EC2 inside the VPC if you allow/configure
they can be connected using on-premises using VPN or direct connection. 
Can also create and attach an internet gateway to a VPC. this allows access to the public internet, as long as, for example EC2 has public
  IP address, also allows access to public AWS services such as S3


Inside the aws public zone, this run between public internet zone and aws private zone
this zone is where aws public services operate from, services with public endpoints such as S3
