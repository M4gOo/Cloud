Facilities - facility, building, physical security
Infra - storage and networking
servers - need to run in a physical server
virtu - those servers run virtualization
O/S - those virtual machines run OS
container - which those OS can be run container. Docker
runtime - languages those app are written needs an environment to run
data - application need to creates or consumes data
app - application itself


some parts you manage and other are by vendor

unit of consumption - netflix you pay for servvice and anything else, create instance on aws you pay only the OS

IaaS - you consume the OS, pay per minute/hour when using. Lose flexibility but the cost and risk are substantial reducted.
PaaS - you consume the  runtime, dont need to worry about infra. Mainly used by developers
SaaS - consume only the application - netflix, dropbox, googlemail
