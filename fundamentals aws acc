aws acc is not the same as user acc
it is a container for users and resources
need and unique email and credit card. For different aws accounts can be used the same credit card
the first user create is root user and cannot be restricted
It is good to have more than one aws acc, because it has a leak or any issue doesnt affect the entire company
By default external access are denied except root user


Identity and Access Management (IAM) service can create groups, roles, users and given full or limited permissions. When created
they dont have any access to aws acc


To secure the AWS acc use MFA
To avoid unintended costs use the budget
best practice IAM admin instead use root user
