AWS have created a global public cloud platform which consists of isolated 'regions' connected together by high speed global networking.
this is good for HA and resilient to failure

2 types of deployment at global level
  aws region - area of the world they selected and inside this region is a full deployment of AWS infra. (N Virginia, Ohio, Seou, Sao Paulo, London,..)
                the allocation for elastic service  in ohio is differente elastic service in sao paulo
  aws edge location - much more smaller than regions, only have contente distribution services. They are useful for Netflix, because they want to
                      store the tv shows close to the customer giving low latency and high speed distribution. Edge location are good for
                      fast efficient data transfer. This case Netflix runs in aws regions and the content in aws edges
                      
   for some services it will change for global, other like ec2 you can choose the region location         
   
   
   Benefits for AWS REGIONS
    isolated fault domain
    different governance (applys laws)
    location control gives performance, so you can be close to your customers
    
    region code: ap-southeast-2 it used in APIs, CLI
    region name: gui
    
    
    inside aws region, aws provide multiple availability zones, in sydney there are 3, those zones are isolated and they have own storage, 
    networking, facilities. So if there is a failure the others zones wont be affected and the service will go to the other zones fully functional
    and available for usage. As solution arch you can put from 6 virtual serves 2 in each availabilty zone. This will give Region resilient
    Services can be placed across multiple availabilty to make resilient, for example of service VPC
    
    If the Availabilty zone fails that service will fail, if the service is put in only one AZ
