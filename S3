simple storage service - S3
global storage 
S# by default is private even says Object can be public, but this doesnt mean it is open for public, just says CAN be public.
buckets names are globally unique, 3 to 63 characters, lower case,nounderscore cant be 1.1.1.1
they are some limits 100soft limit 1000 hard per account in aws acc, to work around make some prefix (acting like folders) that way multiple users in the same bucket
regional resilient, data is replicated across availability zones in that region
public service, unlimited data and multi-user
can be access using GUI,cli,api,http
S3 is an object store, it is not a file/block storage system. You cannot browser through the bucket like file share in windows, also you cannot mount 
because it is not a block/volume. Block storage when you mount in the instances they are basically virtual hard disk (EC2 we have EBS)

S3 is good for large scale data storage, distribution or upload

S3 should be your default store data for any input to aws services or output from aws services 

S3 delivers objects and buckets
  Objects - are the data the S3 stores
  Buckets - are containers for objects

objects are made up two main components - key: photo_name.png (identify the object inside the bucket)
                                          value: content/data of the object (sequence of binary data), the size can be 0 to 5TB
objects also has version id, metadata, access control and subresources

buckets are created in a specific AWS region, never leaves that region unless you configure it
needs to be globally unique, so the name must be unique
only fails when happens a blast radius, when the region had a disaster.
buckets can hold unlimited objects (the size can be 0 to 5TB)
it is flat structure, they are stored at the same level, stored at the root level
folders in S3 are represented when we have objects names structure like /old/photo1.jpg, when you see on GUI it will represent as a folder
s3 doenst really have folders, folders are emulated using prefixes

All resources have a unique identifier - ARN - amazon resource name

to delete buckeyt, first empty the bucket and then delete.
