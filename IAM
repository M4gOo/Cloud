it is globally resilient service, means any data is always secure across all aws regions

IAM service has full trust on aws like root user (the restrictions are billing control and acc closure)

IAM can creeate user, group and role
  user - can be humans or applications
  group - colletion of related users (dev team, prod team, qa team, etc)
  role - used by AWS services or for grant external access to your acc
  user VS role - user it is for individual app/user, role are used when the number of thing is uncertain (external users to access the storage in another account)
  
  
  
  =============== IAM Policy ===================
  they are objects/documents which allow/deny access to aws services when attached to user/group/role. They itself doesnt do anything
  
  
  IAM has 3 main jobs
    identity provider - IDP: create, modify and delete identities such as users and roles
    authenticate (means prove you are who you claim to be - ask username and password) - auth identities such as users and roles
    authorize - this is based on policies associated with identity
    
    IAM identities start with no permissions on an AWS Account
    IAM only controls what is inside your account, not external users
    Identity federation (google, facebook and more to access the aws resource) and MFA auth
