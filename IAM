it is globally resilient service, means any data is always secure across all aws regions

IAM service has full trust on aws like root user (the restrictions are billing control and acc closure)

IAM can creeate user, group and role
  user - can be humans or applications
  group - colletion of related users (dev team, prod team, qa team, etc)
  role - used by AWS services or for grant external access to your acc
  user VS role - user it is for individual app/user, role are used when the number of thing is uncertain (external users to access the storage in another account)
  
  
  
  =============== IAM Policy ===================
  they are objects/documents which allow/deny access to aws services when attached to user/group/role. They itself doesnt do anything
  
  
  IAM has 3 main jobs
    identity provider - IDP: create, modify and delete identities such as users and roles
    authenticate (means prove you are who you claim to be - ask username and password) - auth identities such as users and roles
    authorize - this is based on policies associated with identity
    
    IAM identities start with no permissions on an AWS Account
    IAM only controls what is inside your account, not external users
    Identity federation (google, facebook and more to access the aws resource) and MFA auth


===============IAM identity ================ create an identity

IAM dashboard
  AWS Account
    https://<ID>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console ->sign in URL
      this is needed to use for IAM users, to make easier is good to use alias
      
It is better to create an alias globaly ================ alias
The account alias must be unique across all Amazon Web Services products.

identity are specific in the account they are created, not like the ID which is globally shown above
Access management > users > addusers > ( check the box -Enable console access ) > Set permissions (Attach policies directly - (thick the box -> AdministratorAccess))
at the end can send instructions to the user by email with instructions to access

now to access use the  https://<ID>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console ->sign in URL and the password to access the aws acc.


============== IAM Access keys =======================
 access the account using CLI, APIs
 long term credentials
 access keys can be created, deleted, inactive or active
 
 can have 2 sets od access keys, because usually they make rotating access keys. If one is inactive can stop the services, programming to access the acc, 
 with that you can inactive and active the new set. When generate the second set update all application with the new one and delete the old one.
 
 Root user can have access key bu it is not recommended. 
 
 Iamuser are the only one to use access keys
 
 Iamroles dont use access keys
 
 after generate the access keys -> access key ID + Secret access key (this can only be download/see once)
 To use CLI you need both -> access key ID + Secret access key
